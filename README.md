# What i learn?
So, CodeSandbox wasn't running the code, and it could possibly be that the warnings prevented it from running. Therefore, I switched to running it locally and used Vite, which I think is way better. I learned that you need to pay attention to the words and icons. For example, if a pair of parentheses () is presented, it won't be treated as JavaScript. However, using ({}) will tell the machine that it is JavaScript, and it will run it as such.
